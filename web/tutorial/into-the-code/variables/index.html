				<h2>Variables</h2>
				<p>Author: Steve Russo<br/>Last Updated: August 20, 2015</p>
				<p>
					A variable is a name given to a section of memory that your program controls.
					Read on to learn about how to delare and manipulate variables.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
				<p>
					Delaring a variable is the first thing that must be done before we can use it in any way.
					There are two major parts that go into a variable declaration: the data type and the name.
					All variable declarations follow this pattern: <br/><code>type variable_name;</code><br/>
					Below is an example where we delare a integer variable named count.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">int</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>
<span class="kwd">char</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
				<p>
					You could also declare multiple variables in one statement.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">int</span> <span>count, number, id</span><span>;</span>
<span class="kwd">double</span> <span>rate, deposit_amount</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Initializing Variables</h3>
				<p>
					When a variable is declared, it is assigned the amount of memory mandated by its data type (in this case, int).
					At this point, the value contained in the variable is whatever was already in that section of memory.
					If we want to assign a variable an initial value (which is usually a good idea), we must initialize it.
					Below is an example of initialization of the variable count that is declared as an int.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">int</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>
<span>count</span> <span>=</span> <span class="int">0</span><span>;</span>

<span class="kwd">float</span> <span>f</span><span>;</span>
<span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span class="int">5.7</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
				<p>
					Alternatively, you can declare and initialize a variable in one statement as follows.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">int</span> <span>id = <span class="int">4253</span>, count</span> <span>=</span> <span class="int">0</span><span>;</span>
<span class="kwd">double</span> <span>deposit_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span class="int">753.89</span><span>;</span>
<span class="kwd">char</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span class="int">'C'</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
				<p>
					Either way has the same result: declare count and it holds the value of 0.
				</p>

				<h5>Assigment Operator (=)</h5>
				<p>
					The example above is the first time this tutorial uses the equals sign.
					In C, this is referred to as the assignment operator because it is used to assign values to variables.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Give It a Try</h3>
				<p>
					Now that we know how to declare and initialize a variable, lets give it a try in a program.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="pp"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>

<span class="kwd">int</span> <span>main</span><span>() {</span>
<span class="kwd">&#09;int</span>  count</span> <span>=</span> <span class="int">0</span><span>;</span>
<span class="kwd">&#09;double</span> <span>deposit_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span class="int">753.89</span><span>;</span>
<span class="kwd">&#09;char</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span class="int">'C'</span><span>;</span>

<span>&#09;printf(<span class="str">"%d\n"</span>, count);</span>
<span>&#09;printf(<span class="str">"%f\n"</span>, deposit_amount);</span>
<span>&#09;printf(<span class="str">"%c\n"</span>, c);</span>
<span class="ret">&#09;return </span><span class="int">0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
				<p>
					This code declares an integer variable named count and initializes it to 0.
					Then it prints out the value.
					Experiment with this program by changing the values of the variables in the program.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Valid Identifiers</h3>
				<p>
					Identifier is just another word for a variable or function name.
					In C, identifiers can only consist of letters and numbers and must start with a letter.
					(The underscore character (_) is considered a letter.)
					Variables in C are case-sensitive so a variable named Count is different from a variable named count.
					There is no established way to name variables or functions in C.
