				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Author: Steve Russo<br/>Last Updated: August 20, 2015</p>

					This section kicks off the entire C tutorial.
					In my opinion, the best way to learn any programming language is to actually program with it.
					While this tutorial may have a lot of great information, its no substitute for actually programming and making mistakes when it comes to learning the language.
				</p>

				<h3>Brief History</h3>
				<p>
					C is a procedural<sup>1</sup> programming language developed at AT&T Bell Labs by Dennis M. Ritchie.
					Because C was easier to learn and use than assembly and provided low level capabilities, it was useful for programming software that was previously written in assembly.
					For example, in 1972, C was used to rewrite much of the UNIX operating system which at the time was primarily written in assembly.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>The C Standard</h3>
				<p>
					The C Standard was established to lay out guidelines on the form, interpretation, etc., of C programs.
					The intent of having a set of standards around is to encourage portability<sup>2</sup>.
					It aims to standardize certain aspects of C such as the syntax and the interpretation of the language itself.
					The current C standard is referred to as C11 (as it was drafted in 2011) and the previous standard is C99 (drafted in 1999).
				</p>
				<p>(More details on C11 can be found <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57853">here</a>.)</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Is C "low level"?</h3>
				<p>
					The fact of the matter is that C is a high level programming language despite the low level capabilities it provides.
					At the time it was created, the idea was well established that any language above assembly was considered high level.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, through the years, languages have been developed, such as Java, that are much "higher level" than C.
					For example, Java source code compiles to Java byte code which is then run on the Java Virtual Machine, whereas C code compiles to binary.
					When compared to Java and similar languages, C could be considered "low level" because it is in a relative sense.
					Nonetheless, in a general sense, the truth remains that C is still considered high level.

					<b>FOOTNOTES</b>
					<p>1. <u>procedural</u> (imperative) programming - describes computation as a set of statements or commands that change a programs state.</p>
					<p>
						2. <u>portability</u> - How software behaves in different environments.
						If a program can be compiled on one system and behave the same way on many different systems, it is said to be highly portable.
