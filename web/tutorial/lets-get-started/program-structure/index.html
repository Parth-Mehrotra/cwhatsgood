				<h2>Program Structure</h2>
				<p>Author: Steve Russo<br/>Last Updated: August 20, 2015</p>
				<p>
					Every C program follows a basic structure and has certain behaviors.
					This, along with basic syntax<sup>1</sup>, is covered in the section below.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Main Function</h3>
				<p>
					In order for an operating system to run your program, it has to know where to begin.
					This is why every program must define a function<sup>2</sup> called "main."
					Your program execution will start at the beginning of main.
				</p>
				
				<h5>Exit Status (return 0;)</h5>
				<p>
					Consider the following: you have two programs you would like to run one after the other.
					However, you only want to run the second one if the first one executed successfully.
					How would you determine if the first program had a successful run?
					You could check its exit status.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every program has an exit status which is expressed in the form of an integer.
					This is why in our Hello World example, we give main a return type<sup>3</sup> of int.
					The value returned from main can be your programs exit status. (Zero typically indicates success.)
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Semicolons</h3>
				<p>
					In C and many other programming languages, semicolons are used to terminate statements.
					Notice in the Hello World example covered in the previous seciton, every statement in the main function ended with a semicolon.
					Experiment with the Hello World example by leaving out semicolons.
					Try compiling and read the syntax error you get.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Comments</h3>
				<p>
					Comments are a way to explain and describe your code.
					They are completely ignored by the compiler.
					In C, there are two types of comments: block comments and one line comments.
					Block comments start with "/*" and end with "*/" and can span over multiple lines.
					One line comments start with "//" and end when the line ends.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="com">/* This is a block comment. It can
  span multiple lines. */</span>
<span class="kwd">int</span> <span>main</span><span>() {</span>
<span class="com">&#09;// This is a one line comment</span>
<span class="ret">&#09;return </span><span class="int">0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
				<h5>Why Use Comments?</h5>
				<p>
					One reason to use comments is when you know somebody else is going to be reviewing your code.
					Sometimes, when someone else is trying to figure out what your code does, it's easier to read comments rather than go through and read all the code.
					Another reason may be if you are managing a large amount of source code that gets complicated in some spots.
					It could be to your own benefit to write comments so you know whats happening when look at code after a long time of never seeing it.
				</p>
				<h5>Too Many Comments Can Be Bad</h5>
				<p>
					Some people say there is no such thing as too many comments.
					While commenting can be a good practice, there is such a thing as too many.
					Think about it. If your code is cluttered with comments all over the place, anyone who looks at it will have a hard time figuring out what everything means.
					A good rule of thumb is to write code where comments would be unnecessary.
					When that's not possible, use comments sparingly.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Preprocessor (Basics)</h3>
				<p>
					The preprocessor (usually a separate program invoked by the compiler) can help accomplish several things.
					For now, its important to start off knowing that it allows the programmer to include header files<sup>4</sup>.
					Recall in our Hello World example, that "#include <stdio.h>" was the first line of code.
					When you compile your C source code, the preprocessor looks for lines beginning with a '#' symbol.
					In this case, it finds "#include <stdio.h>" and copies the contents of stdio.h into the source so that we now have the "printf" function declaration (among many other things as well).
