				<h2>Your Privacy Is Important!</h2>
				<p>
					Your right to privacy is very important, especially while browsing the web.
					When information about you is collected without your consent, that is a direct violation of this right.
					This is especially wrong when the information being collected is sensitive in nature or it is being given to third parties without your knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is important to note that we do not give away the data we collect to any one, under any circumstance (unless compelled to by law).
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
				<p>
					Every time your browser loads a page from cwhatsgood.com, there is a piece of javascript that collects analytical data and sends it back to the server.
					The information collected is as follows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span>Browser Name, Code Name, Version, and Engine Name:</span>
						<p>
							This information is pretty self-explanatory.
							(Most modern browsers give a code name of "Mozilla" and an engine name of "Gecko.")
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Platform (Operating System):</span>
						<p>
							This gives information about the operating system that you are running while using the browser.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Language:</span>
						<p>
							The language setting of the browser (e.g. "en-US").
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>User Agent:</span>
						<p>
							This contains the value of the "user-agent" header sent to the server by the browser.
							It contains various information about the browser and operating system.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Why Do We Collect It?</h3>
				<p>
					We collect this data so we can gather and compile anonymous analytical data reports.
					Having this at our disposal helps us look for sponsors and advertisers.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is important to note, none of the data is used to locate, track, or otherwise identify you.
					As you can see, we don't even collect your machine's IP address or timestamp.
