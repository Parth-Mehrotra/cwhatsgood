				<h3>Bitwise AND <code>&</code></h3>
				<p>
					The bitwise AND operator is a binary operator that performs the AND operation on each of the pairs of bits from both operands.
					This means the result will only have a 1 at a certain position if both of the operands have a 1 at that same position.
					Below is an example of raw binary numbers and the result that would come from a bitwise AND operation on them.
				</p>
<pre>
N<sub>1</sub>: 			0010 0110
N<sub>2</sub>: 			0110 0101
			---------
(N<sub>1</sub> & N<sub>2</sub>): 	0010 0100
</pre>
				<p>
					A simple example in C is shown below.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">char</span> n1 = <span class="num">38</span>;
<span class="kwd">char</span> n2 = <span class="num">101</span>;
printf(<span class="str">"%d\n"</span>, (n1 & n2));
</pre>
				<p>
					This above code would output <code>36</code> which is <code>0010 0100</code> in binary.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Bitwise OR <code>|</code></h3>
				<p>
					The bitwise OR operator is a binary operator that performs the OR operation on each of the pairs of bits from both operands.
					This means the result will have a 1 at the position where either operand has a 1.
					Below is an example showing raw binary and the result from a bitwise OR operation on them.
				</p>
<pre>
N<sub>1</sub>: 			0010 0110
N<sub>2</sub>: 			0110 0101
			---------
(N<sub>1</sub> | N<sub>2</sub>): 	0110 0111
</pre>
				<p>
					A simple example in C is shown below.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">char</span> n1 = <span class="num">38</span>;
<span class="kwd">char</span> n2 = <span class="num">101</span>;
printf(<span class="str">"%d\n"</span>, (n1 | n2));
</pre>
				<p>
					This above code would output <code>103</code> which is <code>0110 0111</code> in binary.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Bitwise XOR <code>^</code></h3>
				<p>
					The bitwise XOR operator (sometimes referred to as the "bitwise exclusive OR operator") is a binary operator that performs the XOR operation on each of the pairs of bits from both operands.
					This means the result will have a 1 at the positions where the pairs of bits from each operand are different.
					Below is an example showing raw binary and the result from a bitwise XOR operation on them.
				</p>
<pre>
N<sub>1</sub>: 			0010 0110
N<sub>2</sub>: 			0110 0101
			---------
(N<sub>1</sub> ^ N<sub>2</sub>): 	0100 0011
</pre>
				<p>
					A simple example in C is shown below.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">char</span> n1 = <span class="num">38</span>;
<span class="kwd">char</span> n2 = <span class="num">101</span>;
printf(<span class="str">"%d\n"</span>, (n1 ^ n2));
</pre>
				<p>
					This above code would output <code>67</code> which is <code>0100 0011</code> in binary.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Bitwise NOT <code>~</code></h3>
				<p>
					The bitwise NOT operator (often times referred to as the "One's Compliment operator") is a unary operator that performs the NOT operation on each bit.
					This means if the bit is a 1, it becomes a 0. If the bit is a 0, it becomes a 1.
					The example below uses raw binary to show an operand and the result when the bitwise NOT operation is performed on that operand.
				</p>
<pre>
N<sub>1</sub>: 		0010 0110
		---------
(~N<sub>1</sub>): 	1101 1001
</pre>
				<p>
					A simple example in C is shown below.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">char</span> n1 = <span class="num">38</span>;
printf(<span class="str">"%d\n"</span>, ~n1);
</pre>
				<p>
					The code above would output <code>-39</code> which is <code>1101 1001</code>.
					(Since n1 is a signed char, the high order bit is used to determine if its positive or negative.)
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Bitwise Right Shift <code>&gt;&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>
					The bitwise right shift operator is a binary operator that will shift the first operand's bits to the right the number of times specified by the second operand.
					The example below uses raw binary to show an operand that will have its bits shifted to the right one time.
				</p>
<pre>
N<sub>1</sub>: 			0010 0110
			---------
(~N<sub>1</sub> &gt;&gt; 1): 	0001 0011
</pre>
				<p>
					A simple example in C is shown below.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">char</span> n1 = <span class="num">38</span>;
printf(<span class="str">"%d\n"</span>, (n1 &gt;&gt; <span class="num">1</span>));
</pre>
				<p>
					The code above would output <code>19</code> which is <code>0001 0011</code>.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Bitwise Left Shift <code>&lt;&lt;</code></h3>
				<p>
					The bitwise left shift operator is a binary operator that will shift the first operand's bits to the left the number of times specified by the second operand.
					The example below uses raw binary to show an operand that will have its bits shifted to the left one time.
				</p>
<pre>
N<sub>1</sub>: 			0010 0110
			---------
(~N<sub>1</sub> &lt;&lt; 1): 	0100 1100
</pre>
				<p>
					A simple example in C is shown below.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">char</span> n1 = <span class="num">38</span>;
printf(<span class="str">"%d\n"</span>, (n1 &gt;&gt; <span class="num">1</span>));
</pre>
				<p>
					The code above would output <code>76</code> which is <code>0100 1100</code>.
