				<h3>Logical AND <code>&&</code></h3>
				<p>
					The logical AND operator requires two operands and returns true when both operands are true.
					A boolean expression using the logical AND operator short circuts at the first false value.
					Consider the following code where we check if an integer is inclusively in between 0 and 100:
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="com">// read in an integer</span>
<span class="kwd">int</span> i;
scanf(<span class="str">"%d"</span>, &i);

<span class="com">// check if i is greater than or equal to 0</span>
<span class="com">// and that its less than or equal to 100</span>
<span class="kwd">if</span> (i &gt;= <span class="int">0</span> && i &lt;= <span class="int">100</span>) {
	printf(<span class="str">"%d is between 0 and 100\n"</span>, i);
} <span class="kwd">else</span> {
	printf(<span class="str">"%d is not between 0 and 100\n"</span>, i);
}
</pre>
				<p>
					First, an integer is read in and stored in i.
					Since we are checking if i is within a certain range, we have two conditions to be checked and both must evaluates to true.
					Therefore, we use the logical AND operator which will only return true if both conditions its operating on are true.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Logical OR <code>||</code></h3>
				<p>
					The logical or operator requires two operands and returns true as long as only one of its operands evaluates to true.
					Consider the following code where we check if an integer is outside the range of 0 to 100:
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="com">// read in an integer</span>
<span class="kwd">int</span> i;
scanf(<span class="str">"%d"</span>, &i);

<span class="com">// check if i is less than 0 or</span>
<span class="com">// that its greater than 100</span>
<span class="kwd">if</span> (i &lt; <span class="int">0</span> || i &gt; <span class="int">100</span>) {
	printf(<span class="str">"%d is outside range of 0 and 100\n"</span>, i);
} <span class="kwd">else</span> {
	printf(<span class="str">"%d is in between 0 and 100\n"</span>, i);
}
</pre>
				<p>
					First, an integer is read in and stored in i.
					Since we are checking if i is outside a certain range, we have two conditions to be checked and one of them must evaluate to true.
					Therefore, we use the logical OR operator which will return true if one of the conditions its operating on is true.
					Either i is less than 0 or greater then 100, but it can't be both.
				</p>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Logical NOT <code>!</code></h3>
				<p>
					The logical NOT operand requires one operand and returns the opposite of that operands logical state.
					Example:
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">int</span> t = <span class="int">1</span>;
<span class="kwd">int</span> f = <span class="int">0</span>;

printf(<span class="str">"%d\n"</span>, !t); <span class="com">// prints 0</span>
printf(<span class="str">"%d\n"</span>, !f); <span class="com">// prints 1</span>
</pre>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Ternary <code>?:</code></h3>
				<p>
					The ternary operator(sometimes referred to as the "conditional" operator) requires three operands.
					It is typically used for decision making when assigning values to variables.
					The syntax for the ternary operator is: <br/><code>(condition) ? condition_true : condition_false</code><br/>.
					The code below illustrates how a value would be assigned to a variable using an if statement.
					Assume n has some unknown integer value.
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">int</span> r;
<span class="kwd">if</span> (n != <span class="int">0</span>) {
	r = <span class="int">100</span> / n;
} <span class="kwd">else</span> {
	r = 0;
}
</pre>
				<p>
					This code can be simplified using the ternary operator as shown below:
				</p>
<pre>
<span class="kwd">int</span> r = (n != <span class="int">0</span>) ? <span class="int">100</span> / n : <span class="int">0</span>;
</pre>
				<p>
					The code in both the examples above aims to divide 100 by an integer with an unknown value.
					In order to prevent from dividing by 0 (which causes undefined behavior), there is a check that i is not 0 before any division.
					The code in both examples produce the same exact results. The ternary operator simplifies the code.
